The sentence I worked on, a euphemism for asked Matt for lots of help, had parallel clauses. This required me to make tokens for the clauses that did not have every word. I thought there might be alternatives to making these tokens. There weren't. Each parallel clause had an ablative absolute in it. I forgot how to attach them to sentences or in this case to each parallel clause. Now that I think about it, I'm still not happy with the tree. I still have questions! And yet I understnad (maybe not???) the sentence.
