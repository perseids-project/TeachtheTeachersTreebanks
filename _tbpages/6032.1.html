I found treebanking the first line difficult because I had trouble initially tranlsating the line and understanding the relationship of the punctuation. The colon after the first two words had created a sentence break, but I thought that the rest of the line was in apposition to the direct object "iusta." 
I hesistantly went to edit the xml code and succeeded in continuing the line, but it took me awhile to figure out how the other commas and clauses hung from each other and what were the relationships. This difficulty continued through the next lines. The punctuation and ellipsis of subjects and objects forced me to deal with playing with the xml and adding targets, which really helped me get comfortable doing these things in Arethusa, but I am not confident at all that I have assigned the right relationships to anything I have treebanks so far. 
When we were looking at prose, I understand how everything hung, but poetry is so much harder.
