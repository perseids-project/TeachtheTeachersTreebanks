Level: 

Latin 6, 12th grade (3 students) [reading, writing and speaking Latin]

Goals:

Close analysis of a Latin text will lead to a deeper understanding of the choices that are made by an author, a translator, or a reader in order to convey meaning.

Objectives: 

•	utilize Alpheios to align an existing translation of a provide Latin prose text
•	utilize Alpheios to create/publish a new translation of a provided Latin prose text.
•	utilize Arethusa to treebank provided Latin prose text

Grade:

treebanking graded for accuracy; alignment of existing translation explained in journal entries; 
new translation will be part of a presentation.

Individual or team:

TBD - one part will be group, on part individual; students may choose to divide up the text

Textbook/Author:

Predetermined – e.g. Tacitus on Nero – for the level of the prose and the relevance of the subject.

Board:

Yes; as completely formal as possible – can students collaborate on alignments outside of class?

Publication:

Yes, definitely

Creativity:

Students can determine the amount of collaboration or the rubric for grading and the level of textual alignment. I hope they also manage to include discussion of current leaders and how the translator is influenced by contemporary events.
