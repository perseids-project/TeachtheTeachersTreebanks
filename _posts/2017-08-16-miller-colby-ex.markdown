In this exercise, translate Colby 7: 33-40 into Latin.
Once you have a translation, input both the English and your Latin into Alpheios. 
Align your texts and submit to the board.

This assignment is for my Honors Latin III class. They are using John K. Colby's Review Latin Grammar which is a prose composition text. 
The goal for this assignment is for the students to complete their sentences, but then check them through Alpheios to see if their compositions are aligned to the English sentences.
