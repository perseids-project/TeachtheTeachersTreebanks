The goal of this lesson is to improve students' familiarity with the Perseids Project's Alpheios program and to have student engage with Latin language and texts. 

The warm-up can be reached at the following link:

This portion is a text alignment warm-up that asks students to connect adjective forms with their proper case, number, and gender. It asks students to recognize words that share the same form in addition to helping students to commit these forms to memory. 

Text alignments, however, are primarily translation tools that ask students to consider the relationship between translation and text. The strength of this process is highlighted in part two of the lesson. 

Part two: Text Alignment 

This assignment utilizes an old, "literal" interlinear translation of the Aeneid:

The purpose is to have students understand better what the modern version of interlinear translation is doing by comparing it to the original, non-technological version. In addition, the students should be able to see the one-to-one correlation between the two texts clearly using this translation. The students would align the following:

Then the teacher would ask them to discuss which parts of the translation they agree or disagree with. 

To close the lesson, the instructor will ask students to write a blog post discussing their perspective on the relationship between the translation they have looked at and a second, less literal translation at home. Students will have the weekend to complete the assignment and we will move on to discussions of translations of particular grammatical constructions within the text next week.
