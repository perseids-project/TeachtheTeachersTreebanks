For most readers of Vergil's Eclogues, highly specific vegetal vocabulary poses a serious challenge to translating, understanding, and enjoying the poems. In this assignment, students will use Alpheios to align one such passage, the bouquet that Corydon describes for his beloved, Alexis, in Eclogue 2, with an English translation. Instead of struggling to recall unfamiliar names of plants and flowers, students will be able to use cognates, meter, and a process of elimination to understand how this difficult passage can be rendered in English artfully. Using alignment to work through this passage will leave more time for discussion: "How does word order help the reader visualize the bouquet?" "Where does an artful translation require varying from word choices and sentence structures that would allow for precise alignment?" "What is a quince, anyway?"
